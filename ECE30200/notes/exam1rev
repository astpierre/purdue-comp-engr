content: up to & including moments and their properties (Topic 2.3)

Sets:    
    Notation:
        A = {0,2} // discrete set of 2 things
        B = [0,2] // real interval between 0 and 2 (inclusive)
        B = (0,2) // real interval between 0 and 2 (~inclusive)
    
    Operations + Combinations:
        Union               // A\union B
        Intersection        // A \intersects B
        Complement          // A' or A^c
        Commutative         
        Distributive
        Associative         
        DeMorgan's Rule     // (A \union B)' == A' \intersects B'
        DeMorgan's Rule     // (A \intersects B)' == A' \union B'

    Partitions:
        def: mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (know each)

    Random Experiments:
        Components: 
            - Procedure
            - Observation
    
        Sample space: all possible outcomes

        Event: some possible outcomes

    Problem solving steps:
        1. what is the experiment
        2. what is ss
        3. event we care about


Axioms + Corollaries:
    P(A) >= 0
    P(S) = 1
    P(A') = 1 - P(A)
    if A \intersects B = \nullset --> P(A \union B) = P(A) + P(B)
    P(\nullset) = 0
    Generally...
        P(A \union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \intersects B)
    if A \subset B then P(B) >= P(A)

    (review creating probability table)


Conditional Probability
    Def(s):
        Theorem Total Prob  P(A|B) = P(A \intersects B) / P(B), if P(B) > 0
        
        Baye's Rule         P(B|A) = P(A|B)P(B) / P(A)
            - allows you to flip things around


Independence
    P(B|A) = P(A) iff indep
    P(A)P(B) = P(A \intersects B)
    if A + B are independent unless P(A) == 0 or P(B) == 0
    else disjoint if P(A \intersects B) = 0 --> P(A \union B) = P(A) + P(B)

    if P(A|B) = P(A) then P(B|A) = P(B)

    What would it take for 3 events to be independent?
        all pairwise independence
        mutually 3-way independent
        P(A \intersects B \intersects C) == P(A)P(B)P(C)


Sequential Experiments
    - many cases, solvable using tree diagram
    - rely on cond prob heavily
    

Random Variables
    X(w) takes a random outcome and produces a number
    events:
        { X <= x }
        { X = x }
        { a <= x <= b }
    1. the observation is a number
    2. a function of the outcome
    3. a function of another RV
        Y = area, X = length
        Y = X^2


PMF (prob mass func)
    repr = table or graph, remember the else
    P(X = x) = p_X(x)

CDF (cumul dens func)
    F_X(x) = P(X <= x) (defined for all x)
    P(a < x < b)
    P(a <= x <= b) == P(a=x) + P(x=b) + P(a < x < b)
    
    ex. some cdf w/ disc. @a
    P(X = a) == P(X = a+0.000...1) - P (X = a-0.000...1) // the height of jump

    Computing probabilities:
        P(a < X <= b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)

Properties
    PMF
        1. p_X(x) >= 0
        2. \sum p_X(x) for all x == 1
        3. P(B) = \sum p_X(x) for all x \in B

    CDF
        1. lim x->\infinity F_X(x) = 1
        2. lim x->\negativeinfinity F_X(x) = 0
        3. non-decreasing
        4. continuous from the right
            line->open dot->gap->closed dot->line == OK
            line->closed dot->gap->open dot->line == NOT OK
        5. P(X > x) = 1 - F_X(x)

    PDF
        1. f_X(x) >= 0, for all x
        2. \integral from -\inf to +\inf

    delta functions (useful for expected values)
        - review sifting property
        

Moments (expec, var)
    E(X) = \sum x p_X(x)                      ~ discrete RV
    E(X) = \integral -inf to +inf x*f_X(x)dx  ~ any RV
    Var(X)  = 2nd central moments
            = E[(X-\mu)^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
    Std(X) = sqrt(Var(X))
    nth moment = E[X^n]

Misc Tips:
    \integral x^n dx == x^(n+1) / (n+1) + c

    if g(x) == odd function
        integral from -a to a of g(x)dx == 0

        integral from a+5 to a+10 of g(x)dx --> try to use ch of vars
