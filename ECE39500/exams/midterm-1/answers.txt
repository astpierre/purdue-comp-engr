2. To change one of the behaviors of a Duck, I would create another class that implemented the desired modification to the existing behavior and then wrap the Duck class by this modified decorator class.

3. Would need to create a new strategy implementation that added Mocha during the coffee creation algorithm.

4.
    - Ducks have behavioral characteristics
    - each behavior is similar and static (not composed ie. no quack + squeak)

5.
    - Coffee is a very personalized object
    - a decorator pattern allows for a more a-la-carte method of creating varients
    - strategy method would be better if coffees only were made in specific ways
