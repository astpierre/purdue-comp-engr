Static casts
    When static casting student to faculty or faculty to student, compile
    time errors occurred. I was able to compile the void pointer assignment
    to student, but a segmentation fault occurred at run time.
Dynamic casts
    When dynamic casting student to faculty or faculty to student, run
    time errors occurred (segmentation faults). I was unable to compile the
    void pointer assignment to student because the source (v) was not a
    pointer to class.
