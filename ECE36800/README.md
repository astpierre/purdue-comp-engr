# ECE368 Data Structures Course Projects
> ECE36800 Data Structures taken Spring 2019 at Purdue University

### Programming Assignment 2
#### Description
> Implemented Shell sort on an array and Shell sort on a linked list.


### Programming Assignment 3
#### Description
> A program to compute the signal delay of an RC (resistive-capacitive) tree, represented by a strictly binary tree  


### Programming Assignment 4  
#### Description  
> A program to construct a height-balanced binary search tree
(BST), starting from an empty tree, based on a sequence of insertion and deletion operations.  

### Programming Assignment 5  
#### Description  
> An implementation of an optimized Quicksort and optimized MergeSort algorithns.  

### Programming Assignment 6
#### Description  
> A program involving perhaps “graph traverals” to compute the “packing” of rectangles, represented by a sequence pair SP(S_1, S_2).
