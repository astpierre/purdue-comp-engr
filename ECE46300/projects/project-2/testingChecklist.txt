BASIC CONVERGENCE TEST CASES:
Basic 2_routers.conf Convergence:   consistently gets correct routing table
Basic 4_routers.conf Convergence:   consistently gets correct routing table
Basic 5_routers.conf Convergence:   consistently gets correct routing table
Basic 10_routers.conf Convergence:  consistently gets correct routing table
=================================================

=================================================
VALGRIND TEST CASE:
Indicate Topology: 4_routers.conf
Result of Valgrind: nothing definitely lost, some possibly lost
=================================================

KILL AND REVIVE ROUTER TEST CASE:
Indicate Topology: 2_routers.conf
Indicate Router to kill/revive: 1
Convergence after Killing Router: consistently gets correct routing table
Convergence after RevivingRouter: consistently gets correct routing table
=================================================
=================================================
KILL AND REVIVE ROUTER TEST CASE:
Indicate Topology: 4_routers.conf
Indicate Router to kill/revive: 1
Convergence after Killing Router: consistently gets correct routing table
Convergence after RevivingRouter: does not always converge to correct tables
=================================================
=================================================
KILL AND REVIVE ROUTER TEST CASE:
Indicate Topology: 5_routers.conf
Indicate Router to kill/revive: 1
Convergence after Killing Router: consistently gets correct routing table
Convergence after RevivingRouter: does not always converge to correct tables
=================================================
=================================================
KILL AND REVIVE ROUTER TEST CASE:
Indicate Topology: 10_routers.conf
Indicate Router to kill/revive: 1
Convergence after Killing Router: consistently gets correct routing table
Convergence after RevivingRouter: does not always converge to correct tables
