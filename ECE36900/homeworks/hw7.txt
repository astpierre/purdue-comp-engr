                  	ECE 369 Homework 7 (Sixth Edition)


Please read section 8.2 in the textbook.  

All problems from this homework apply to outcome 6.

From Section 8.2: problems 29, 30, 33,
                          36(except c),
                          43(hint: use Kleene's theorem)

E1.Find a simple nondeterministic finite automaton accepting the
   regular language (ab v aab v aba)*.

E2.Convert the automaton you drew in problem E1 to a deterministic
   finite automaton accepting the same language using the construction
   shown in class.


E3.Convert the following NFA into a regular expression by eliminating
   state s2 and then state s1 using the technique shown in class.

   M=(s0,S,I,F,f_S), where S={s0,s1,s2,f}, I={0,1}, F={f}, and

   f_S(s0,0)=s1
   f_S(s0,1)=s2
   f_S(s1,1)=s1
   f_S(s1,0)=s2
   f_S(s2,0)=s1
   f_S(s2,1)=s2
   f_S(s2,\lambda)=f  \lambda is the empty string.
